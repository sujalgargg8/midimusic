# Project Title: AI Music Composer
# Description
The AI Music Composer is an innovative project aimed at exploring the capabilities of artificial intelligence in the field of music creation. Leveraging Google's Magenta library and TensorFlow, this project utilizes deep learning techniques, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to generate novel music compositions from learned musical data.

# Features
Music Generation: Generates music in MIDI format, which can be used to produce actual audio tracks.
Customizable Genres: Capable of learning and generating music in various genres by training on specific datasets.
Interactive Interface: (if applicable) Includes a basic web interface where users can specify parameters for music generation like genre, tempo, and mood.
# Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.
Magenta: A deep learning library for music and art generation.
TensorFlow: An open-source framework for machine learning.
MIDI: Musical Instrument Digital Interface, used as the format for training data and generated music outputs.
# How to Run
Setup Environment: Ensure Python 3.7 and all required packages are installed.
Activate Virtual Environment:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (make sure to include a requirements.txt in your repository)
Run Preprocessing: python preprocess.py to convert MIDI files to a trainable format.
Train the Model: python train.py to start the training process.
Generate Music: python generate.py to use the trained model to create new music pieces.
# Dataset
This project uses MIDI files as the dataset for training. These files contain musical notation in a digital format that the model learns to interpret and reproduce in creative ways.

# Goal
The aim is to bridge the gap between technology and creativity, providing a tool that can assist musicians, producers, and enthusiasts in creating unique musical pieces, thereby enhancing the creative process through AI.
